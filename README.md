# Dragon-Ball

## ✅Project Overview

This project was developed as a task for the neighborhood comic store, which is a big fan of Dragonball. The store wanted a web page inspired by the official [Dragonball API](https://web.dragonball-api.com) and asked to create a website with the same style but with a unique touch of creativity.

The website retrieves information about Dragonball characters and planets using the API provided by the Dragonball website. The project involves building a fully responsive site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while ensuring the information is paginated and displayed on a single page for each section (characters and planets).

## ✅Features

- Character Page: Displays a list of Dragonball characters with details like name, gender, race, base KI, total KI, and affiliation.
- Planet Page: Displays information about planets from the Dragonball universe, such as the name, status (destroyed or not), and a short description.
- Load More Functionality: Both the characters and planets pages feature a "Load More" button to fetch additional results without reloading the page.
- Scroll to Top Button: A button to scroll to the top of the page after viewing the content at the bottom.
- Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and adapts to tablet and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on all screen sizes.
- Custom Animations: Includes falling stars animation on the planet page and other effects for dynamic interaction.

## ✅API Integration

The website uses the [Dragonball API](https://web.dragonball-api.com) to retrieve information. It fetches the characters and planets data using the following endpoints:

- Characters Endpoint: [Dragonball Characters](https://dragonball-api.com/api/characters)
- Planets Endpoint: [Dragonball Planets](https://dragonball-api.com/api/planets)

Data is retrieved in paginated format and displayed dynamically on the page. Each page starts with a set number of items and can load more upon user request.
